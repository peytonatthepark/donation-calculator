Build an interactive donation calculator to enhance the donor experience before redirecting to Qgiv for final donation processing. The calculator will be hosted externally (on GitHub) and embedded in Qgiv via iframe.

üß† Purpose:
Help donors visualize the real-world impact of their contributions by allocating their donation across different bundle categories.

üìã Requirements:
1. User Interaction Flow:

User enters any donation amount (e.g., $200).

Then, 8 donation categories appear ‚Äî each with a drag slider representing the number of "kits" (or bundles) that can be selected from that category.

Each category has a fixed cost per kit, and selecting more will deduct from the total donation.

Once the user‚Äôs remaining balance is too low to afford any more kits in certain categories, those categories fade out and become unselectable.

A live summary panel shows:

Number of kits per category selected

Total spent

Remainder (unallocated amount, if any)

2. Categories & Costs:

const categories = [
  {
    name: "Hygiene Kits",
    cost: 35,
    items: ["Shampoo", "Conditioner", "Body Wash", "Deodorant", "Razors", "Dental Care", "Feminine Hygiene"]
  },
  {
    name: "Outreach Supplies",
    cost: 50,
    items: ["Sleeping Bag", "Tent", "Blanket", "Tarp", "Pillow"]
  },
  {
    name: "Pet Supplies",
    cost: 30,
    items: ["Dog Food", "Cat Food", "Cat Litter"]
  },
  {
    name: "Clothing & Accessories",
    cost: 25,
    items: ["Backpack", "Purse"]
  },
  {
    name: "Non-Perishable Foods",
    cost: 20,
    items: ["Canned Goods", "Meal Packs"]
  },
  {
    name: "Safe Parking",
    cost: 500,
    items: ["Secure Parking Spot", "Basic Amenities", "Safety Monitoring"]
  },
  {
    name: "Move-in Costs",
    cost: 1000,
    items: ["First Month Rent", "Deposit", "Utility Setup"]
  },
  {
    name: "Kitchen Essential Equipment",
    cost: 5000,
    items: ["Microwave", "Cookware", "Utensils", "Dish Set", "Small Appliances"]
  }
];
3. Final Action:

Prominent ‚ÄúGive‚Äù button at the end.

On click, user is redirected to a Qgiv donation page with a customizable message or receipt that summarizes their selected items (optional: pass data via URL or local storage if possible).

üíª Tech Stack:
Use whatever is most sustainable, maintainable, and clean for long-term embedding (e.g., plain HTML/CSS/JS is fine; light frameworks like Vue/React also okay if needed).

Needs to:

Be embeddable in Qgiv via iframe

Be deployable via GitHub Pages

üé® Visual Notes:
Clean, vertical layout:

Branding header (Church at the Park)

Optional story feed or donor stories

Calculator with sliders

Summary & Give button

Style to match Church at the Park branding (placeholder colors OK for now)

üõ† Output:
Complete code: index.html, script.js, styles.css

Responsive, mobile-friendly

Ready for embedding in Qgiv via iframe

Optional: include mock Qgiv redirection for testing
